## Microcontroller Project: StarBlasters

![StarBlaster Blast](/images/starblaster_blast.gif)  
I created this simple StarBlasters video game using the Cypress PSoC 4 Microcontroller. It incorporated the color LCD, several buttons, and a joystick. A joystick press creates a blast that temporarily takes out the stars within its radius. When the crosshairs are moved to the edge of the screen, the starfield scrolls; and randomly chosen stars on the starfield twinkle periodically.
