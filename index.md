- I implemented the Huffman compression algorithm.
- My program could encode, store, and decode files using a huffman coding binary search tree
- I also wrote comprehensive automatic unittests, encompassing ----- cases

-Stores data in a sorted list with no duplicates.
-This program was one of my first experiences writing my own data type. I focused on making my code well-documented, readable, effective, and effecient. 
-Writing a linked list allowed me to practice extensively with pointers and member functions as well as friend functions, interactions between classes, and iterators.
