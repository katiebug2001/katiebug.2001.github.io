### Huffman Tree

- I implemented the Huffman compression algorithm.
- My program could encode, store, and decode files using a huffman coding binary search tree.
- I also wrote comprehensive automatic unittests.
- Although it was a challenge at first, I really enjoyed using bit masking and bit manipulation during this project. 
- This program also let me practice not only writing a binary search tree, but building one from a given data set and then using it throughout the compression process, storing it in the compressed file, and reconstructing it during the decompression processs.

<br>
- Stores data in a sorted list with no duplicates.
- This program was one of my first experiences writing my own data type. I focused on making my code well-documented, readable, effective, and efficient. 
- Writing a linked list allowed me to practice extensively with pointers and member functions as well as friend functions, interactions between classes, and iterators.

- A programming course to build a fully functional computing platform up from a NAND gate
- <a href = "https://www.nand2tetris.org/" style = "color:#E51746">Course Website</a>
- I completed part 1, which was the hardware component of the course
- This course helped me to connect the low-level digital logic I love to assembly language and fully understand every step along the way.

### Triangle Area

<br>
- My MIPS assembly program to calculate the area of a triangle
- I was commended by my professor for my work on this assignment, and he used my code for the solution given to the class. 
- Learning assembly and writing programs in it helped me understand compilers better and made me think about how to be more efficient when using high-level languages, as well as giving me a better appreciation for those high level languages!
