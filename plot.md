I developed this project in several stages over multiple years. It began as a small personal project that I then developed a full design for in my Software Systems Design class. For my Software Capstone class, I developed the app alongside my team and acted as the lead developer. I polished the code as well as expanding and refining the functionality for my Honors Senior Project.

See a full product description and user manual, explore the code, or download the app at its [github repo](https://github.com/katiehons/plot2)
